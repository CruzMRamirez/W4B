# W4B
A repository meant for the daily challenge work for Bitwise Industries' class.

## Programming Joke
A programmer's wife tells her husband "Can you go to the store and buy 4 eggs? If there is milk, bring one." The programmer's wife is mad when he brought 1 egg. What happened?

## Resources for the class
[W3schools.com](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=w3schools), 
[Css Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), 
[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

## Recent Updates to Repository
Updated Day 1 folder and gave a detailed description on how to do Day 5.

## Q&A
### When does this get updated?
This will be updated at the end of every class, once after the daily challenge has been completed

### Why is there little to no comments on days 1-5?
This was created during the middle of day 5. Day 6+ will have more explanations and more comments. Eventually I will go back and add more comments and refining the code.

### Will the Final Project be added here?
No, I think the final project will most likely contain resources for you to use.
