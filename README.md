# W4B
A repository meant for the daily challenge work for Bitwise Industries' class.

## Programming Joke
There are three kinds of lies: Lies, damned lies, and benchmarks

## Resources for the class
Here are a few links to get you started,
[W3schools.com](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=w3schools), 
[Css Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/), 
[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). 
If you are in the class you should also have access to our google docs. Here is a link to the resources we have shown or used in the class. [Google Doc: Our Resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RI0uQnst4AINq3Y30jaHm3aQ3DXEroAGLOuFja1ugE4/edit?usp=sharing)

## Recent Updates to Repository
Added Day 7-8 folder containing all info about creating ssh, command prompt commands, and github commands.

## Q&A
### Can I request additions to the repository?
I'll take all requests into consideration. If you have something you would like for me to add to the repository, ask during class or through slack.

### When does this get updated?
This will be updated at the end of every class, once after the daily challenge has been completed

### Why is there little to no comments on days 1-5?
This was created during the middle of day 5. Day 6+ will have more explanations and more comments. Eventually I will go back and add more comments and refining the code.

### Will the Final Project be added here?
No, I think the final project will most likely contain resources for you to use.
