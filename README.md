# W4B
A repository meant for the daily challenge work for Bitwise Industries' class.

## Programming Joke
A programmer's wife tells her husband "Can you go to the store and buy 4 eggs? If there is milk, bring one." The programmer's wife is mad when he brought 1 egg. What happened?

## Resources for the class
Here are a few links to get you started,
[W3schools.com](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=w3schools),

If you are in the class you should also have access to our google docs. Here is a link to the resources we have shown or used in the class. [Google Doc: Our Resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RI0uQnst4AINq3Y30jaHm3aQ3DXEroAGLOuFja1ugE4/edit?usp=sharing)

## Recent Updates to Repository
Added Day 6. 
Updated Day 1 and Day 2 folder. 
Gave a detailed description on how to do Day 5.

## Q&A
### Can I request additions to the repository?
I'll take all requests into consideration. If you have something you would like for me to add to the repository, ask during class or through slack.

### When does this get updated?
This will be updated at the end of every class, once after the daily challenge has been completed

### Why is there little to no comments on days 1-5?
This was created during the middle of day 5. Day 6+ will have more explanations and more comments. Eventually I will go back and add more comments and refining the code.

### Will the Final Project be added here?
No, I think the final project will most likely contain resources for you to use.
