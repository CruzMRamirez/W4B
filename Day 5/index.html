        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>First we are going to start with creating the html structure.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Secondly, we are going to create the page's structure.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Once creating both structures, you're ready for styling. Lets go ahead and give them all different colors and a padding of 5px!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>After the colors have been added, we are going to go ahead and give them all heights and.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Next, we will be adding width to the follwing elements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Container</li>
                    <li>Wrapper</li>
                    <li>Aside</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>We will finish by adding the float property to the wrapper and the aside tags. we will also need to use the clear property on the footer tag.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <!-- Lines 42 - 63 are going to be considered as the page's structure-->

    <div class="container">
